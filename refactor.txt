I made updates to 5 cards. 
There are new functions which correspond to:
    gardens card
    smithy card
    steward card
    embargo card
    outpost card

Within the switch statement, the corresponding case will call each of the these functions.
The return value of the function will be propagated up into the return value for the associated switch-case.

The only files included are dominion.c, dominion.h and dominiion_helpers.h
